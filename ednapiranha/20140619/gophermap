0Communication isn't about cashing out fast

0Early on in the meatspace chat days, there was a lot of immediate buzz about whether it was going to become an official startup and I would cash out or ride some startup wave before everyone lost interest.

0I would be lying if I said I didn't consider it - I even had strangers come up and try to negotiate partnerships just to get a cut of the action. Some seemed more sincere than others, but I ended up going with my gut instinct saying the same thing to every person:

0"This isn't ready; this isn't anything at all. It's just an elaborate demo and it's entertaining."

0I sometimes go back and forth at the stance I held onto and wondered if I made a mistake. Watching all these startups and their mindless, crappier variations of meatspace chat - with their lack of emotion, lack of concern and lack of attention - receiving large virtual bags of investment money from various players in the chess game of capital gain ... it made me think maybe I really screwed up. Maybe I should have just sold out by playing the high stakes game of "lose 99% of the time, get the gold 1% of the other time if the moon is in the right phase".

0But fast forward to a little over a year from when this project first was on Github. And only about nine months since it went public at a conference. A lot has happened in nine months but it also hasn't been a lot of time in the larger scale of life.

0But in these nine months, hundreds of people have connected through these meatspace projects. They would have never ever have met through your usual mega corporate social network like Facebook or Twitter. They met through this tiny elaborate demo open source project and then met in person and collaborated and shared their personal stories. They spread their communications through other mediums as they saw fit.

0I watch their interactions and participate sometimes but I also think they are the creators and maintainers of what becomes all parts of the community and their inevitable sub-communities.

0Like a fractal, these interactions are the key to understanding how humans interact and react. How they change or are similar as time and culture continue to expand and transform. Then the questions arise. Do these patterns only happen in this specific community? Or do they happen for all communities? Is it based on culture? Or is it based on something else?

0In the end of all these thoughts, I always cycle from the beginning of this post to the end - concluding that the decision I made was the right one. There is something even better than cashing out quickly on a minor social entertainment. It is just a stepping stone to something better in improving the way we "become" in the digital realm. What that is will become more apparent as we build more of these kinds of projects and continue participating and observing.
